# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Vite + React application following the official documentation guidelines.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package using npm
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the new dependency and its 311 sub-dependencies

### 2. Code Changes

**Modified: `src/App.jsx`**
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react'`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component at the end of the JSX structure (before the closing fragment)
- The component is placed after the Routes container to ensure it tracks all page navigation

## Implementation Details

Following the Vercel Speed Insights documentation for React/Vite applications, the `SpeedInsights` component was added to the main App component. This is a wrapper around the tracking script that offers seamless integration with React applications.

The component will:
- Automatically track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, FCP, TTFB)
- Monitor page navigation and route changes via React Router
- Send performance metrics to Vercel's Speed Insights dashboard once deployed

## Verification

✅ **Build Status**: Successful
- Project builds without errors
- Output bundle size: 1,175.24 kB (gzipped: 342.80 kB)

✅ **Linting**: No new errors introduced
- The changes to App.jsx pass all linting rules
- Pre-existing linting errors in Valentine.jsx are unrelated to this implementation

## Next Steps

To complete the Speed Insights setup on Vercel:

1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. Deploy the application to Vercel using `vercel deploy` or by connecting the git repository
3. After deployment, verify the `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` is present in the page
4. View metrics in the Vercel dashboard under the Speed Insights tab

## Files Modified

- `src/App.jsx` - Added SpeedInsights component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree
